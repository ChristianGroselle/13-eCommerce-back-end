## Description

---

This project is a back end api for a eCommerce app built using sequelize.

This was done by:

-Using mySql as a database structure.\
-Utilizing sequelize to make easier and more concise database queries.\
-Utilizing express router to help modularize the routes.\
-Using Insomnia to test the routes.

This was done because:

-Having a robust back end is important for an eCommerce site.\
-Using modular routes becomes important as app get more complex.\
-Sequelize makes the code much more readable thus easier to debug and maintain.
